# Team Citrus Game Engine

A game engine with a currently pending name and readme.
For this game engine, we have a simple goal in mind, we want to create a simple, extendable, well documented, game engine.
We also intend to use this game engine in our future projects, and hope others adopt it as well.

## Compiling requirements

- Python
- SCons
- Vulkan SDK
- OpenGL SDK
- GLM
- box2d
- Bullet
- G++, MSVC, or compatible C++ compiler
- (Optionally, though preferably) Make

## TODOs

### High priority

- [ ] Get a name for the engine
- [ ] Write a proper readme
- [ ] Create build system
- [ ] Create code structure
- [ ] Create formating guide
