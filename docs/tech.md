# Technologies in use

For graphics, Vulkan is the primary API.
OpenGL should be supported for systems without Vulkan support.
Both will also use GLFW and GLM to make all of our lives easier.

For physics, things are split.
For 2D physics, box2d.
For 3D physics, bullet.

Rendering will be handled in house.

Sound is currently TBD.
